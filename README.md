# MindPalace: A Trust-First AI Framework

MindPalace is an open-source AI assistant designed to empower users by trusting them with full control.
Built on a lightweight, event-sourced foundation, it runs locally using small, unbiased models—free from corporate agendas or bloated frameworks.
Its modular core leverages plugin agents, like task managers or code assistants, to extend functionality, all configurable via voice or text.
This isn’t about dictating needs; it’s about enabling computers to bend to the user’s will, delivering a lean, adaptable toolset for a truly personal digital experience.
